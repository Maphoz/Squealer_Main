- **Admin Platform**: Created with **Plain JavaScript**, where administrators manage the content and users.
- **Social Media Manager (SMM) Platform**: Built using **Vue.js**, allowing content managers to handle the marketing aspects of the platform.

The backend is powered by **Node.js**, with a **GraphQL** API, and data is stored in **MongoDB**.
